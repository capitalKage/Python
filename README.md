# Python3 project milestone and completion average generation tool

Hi, tool is just an idea I had for generating and managing project milestones and completion percentages as a project manager.

The tool will request the end user to write all the milestones and current percentages for each within the users project/program. Once completed, the program will generate a list of the milestones and the average completion for the project.

Looking to update the program over time, this is just simple functionality of inputs into lists, writing to txt file, and calculating the average.
